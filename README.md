# RMC

Rivello Multimedia Consulting has multiple frameworks for MVC in Unity.

# UMVCS 

The UMVCS library for Unity is a custom framework embracing the [MVCS architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller).

MVCS is one of many solutions for organizing a Unity projec efficiently. It may or may not be the best solution for you.

## UMVCS MVCS Is Light

The UMVCS MVCS library a solution for MVCS architecture within Unity. It is **heavily-dependant** on **MonoBehaviour** as a It has no dependencies on 3rd party libraries.

## UMVCS Is Free

The UMVCS MVCS library for Unity Development is free. Created by Rivello Multimedia Consulting.

## UMVCS Is Simple & Proven

## UMVCS is Flexible

It has few classes and a flexible pattern. Following the conventions of MVCS requires discipline as the system is purposefully light and flexible. For example the a model instance **can** access another model instance, but it is recommended not to do so.

## UMVCS Best Practices

### Communication

UMVCS is flexible and does not prevent actor-actor communication. However, best practices are to limit communication.

**Communication Channels**

* Methods - The caller scope has a reference to the called scope and "calls a method" in the typical sense. This is the most coupled communication channel
* Events - [Observer pattern](https://www.dofactory.com/net/observer-design-pattern) where the reciever **has** a reference to the sender
* Commands - [Observer pattern](https://www.dofactory.com/net/observer-design-pattern) where the reciever **has no** reference to the sender. This is the least coupled communication channel

**Communication Suggestions**

| --              | To Model     | To View                 | To Controller | To Service     |
|-----------------|--------------|-------------------------|---------------|----------------|
| From Model      | ❌           | ❌                     | ✔️(Events)    | ❌           |
| From View       | ❌           | ❌                     | ✔️(Events)    | ❌           |
| From Controller | ✔️(Methods)  | ✔️(Methods/Commands)  | ✔️(Commands)  | ✔️(Methods)  |
| From Service    | ❌           | ❌                    | ✔️(Events)    | ❌           |

## UMVCS Appropriateness

MVCS is one of many solutions for organizing a Unity projec efficiently. It may or may not be the best solution for you.


| MVCS Pros                         | MVCS Cons     |
|-----------------------------------|---------------|
| Code is highly maintainable       | Code is highly repetitive                                   | 
| Code is highly extensible         | Project navigation requires more time                       | 
| Faster to update an existing project    | Slower To start a new project                         | 
| Adding a new feature is prescriptive          | Adding a new feature may require more classes     | 
| Faster learning curve to onboard veterans     | Slower learning curve to onboard newbies          | 
| Suggested for projects of medium/large scope  | Not Suggested for projects of small scope         | 
| Model is highly testable (TDD)                |                                                  | 
| Coding invites less debate                   | Coding requires more discipline                  | 

**Appropriateness For Games**

For projects where runtime optimization is essential, coding directly (without MVCS), may yield better performance.

However, that is likely a subsection of a game. The rest of the game may still benefit from MVCS. There is indeed flexibility for such a hybrid solution.

## Install

### via Git URL

Open `Packages/manifest.json` with your favorite text editor. Add following line to the dependencies block:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "com.rmc.rmc-umvcs": "https://github.com/SamuelAsherRivello/rmc-umvcs.git"
  }
}
```

### Tests

The package can optionally be set as *testable*.
In practice this means that tests in the package will be visible in the [Unity Test Runner](https://docs.unity3d.com/2017.4/Documentation/Manual/testing-editortestsrunner.html).

Open `Packages/manifest.json` with your favorite text editor. Add following line **after** the dependencies block:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
  },
  "testables": [ "com.rmc.rmc-umvcs" ]
}
```

### Import Samples
To see clear use cases, import and run the samples:

1. Open Unity and then open `Window > Package Manager`
1. Select `RMC UMVCS` 
1. Select Samples and import
